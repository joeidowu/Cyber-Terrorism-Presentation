# Cyber-Terrorism-Presentation
This project is a PowerPoint presentation I created on the topic of Cyber Terrorism. The purpose of this work is to explain the concept of cyber terrorism, why it matters in todayâ€™s world, and how it impacts both national security and everyday life. As societies and economies become increasingly dependent on digital systems, the risks posed by politically motivated cyberattacks continue to grow.

The presentation not only defines cyber terrorism but also examines its historical context, notable real-world incidents, and the motivations behind these attacks. It further explores how governments, organizations, and individuals can respond to and defend against such threats. By researching and presenting this topic, my goal was to strengthen my understanding of cybersecurity from both a technical and policy perspective, while also developing clear communication skills to explain complex issues to a broader audience.
