# Cyber-Terrorism-Presentation
This project is a PowerPoint presentation I created on the topic of Cyber Terrorism. The purpose of this work is to explain the concept of cyber terrorism, why it matters in todayâ€™s world, and how it impacts both national security and everyday life. As societies and economies become increasingly dependent on digital systems, the risks posed by politically motivated cyberattacks continue to grow.

The presentation not only defines cyber terrorism but also examines its historical context, notable real-world incidents, and the motivations behind these attacks. It further explores how governments, organizations, and individuals can respond to and defend against such threats. By researching and presenting this topic, my goal was to strengthen my understanding of cybersecurity from both a technical and policy perspective, while also developing clear communication skills to explain complex issues to a broader audience.

I listed below a few of the slides in the presentaion with a description labeled under each image.

A cyber attack is a deliberate attempt by individuals or groups to gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or digital devices with the goal of stealing, disrupting, damaging, or manipulating information. These attacks can take many forms, including malware infections, ransomware, phishing schemes, denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities. Cyber attacks may target individuals, businesses, or even entire governments, often leading to financial losses, compromised data, service outages, or reputational harm. Because the methods are constantly evolving, defending against cyber attacks requires ongoing vigilance, updated security practices, and strong awareness of common threats.

Cyber terrorism is the use of digital attacks to create fear, disruption, or harm in pursuit of political, religious, or ideological goals. Unlike ordinary cybercrime, which is usually motivated by profit, cyber terrorism seeks to intimidate or coerce governments, organizations, or societies. These attacks often target critical infrastructure such as power grids, financial systems, transportation networks, or healthcare services, since disrupting them can cause widespread panic and damage. Common methods include denial-of-service attacks, malware, ransomware, and data breaches. The intent behind cyber terrorism is not only to cause technical disruption but also to influence political decisions, destabilize societies, or spread fear on a large scale.

Cyber terrorism remains one of the most complex challenges in the modern security landscape. Unlike traditional cybercrime, its goal is not just financial gain but to spread fear, disrupt societies, and influence political decisions. As more critical infrastructure from power grids to healthcare systems relies on interconnected technology, the potential consequences of these attacks become increasingly severe.
Through this project, I learned that addressing cyber terrorism requires more than just technical solutions. It also demands cooperation between governments, private organizations, and international partners, as well as continuous public education on cybersecurity best practices. By researching this topic, I was able to strengthen my knowledge of both the technical and strategic dimensions of cybersecurity while sharpening my ability to communicate these issues clearly through a structured presentation.
